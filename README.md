Ansible NGINX Security Monitoring
=========

This ansible role helps in installing Nginx App Protect Compiler on NGINX Instance Manager. 

Requirements
------------
1. NGINX Management Suite License Files
2. NGINX Ansible Role (nginxinc.nginx)
3. Ansible Role NGINX Management Suite (nginxinc.nginx)

NGINX Management Suite Certificate Files
------------
Installing NMS requires the NMS certificate files to access the repository. Log in to MyF5 or follow the link in the trial activation email to download the NMS repo .crt and .key files:

- nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.key
- nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.crt

- NOTE: Be sure to rename these files to nginx-repo.key and nginx-repo.crt, respectively.

NGINX Instance
NMS requires an NGINX instance, either NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus as a frontend only. This role handles this by defining a dependency to the NGINX Ansible Role, named nginxinc.nginx. Because of this dependance, you can set variables related to nginxinc.nginx when using this role. For example, nginx_type is an nginxinc.nginx variable that can be set like how you would any other Ansible variable. So if your playbook defines nginx_type: plus, this NMS role will call the nginxinc.nginx role which will install NGINX Plus. Refer to the Ansible Role NGINX for more details.

Main difference between using NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus depends on which Authentication Option you plan to use.

Ansible
--------
This role is developed and tested with maintained versions of Ansible core (above 2.12).
